# Mapping_Earthquakes
Creating interactive maps using the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL.

## Background
### Overview
This project consists of four technical analysis deliverables.

- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.



## Methodology

-Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
Now that you have an overview of the project plan, let's set up a Mapbox account and get the API token you'll need to create geographical maps.


## Resources
 
Data source:
- (1) major_eq_starter_logic.js, (2) challenge_logic.js, (3) chart.js
 
Software:
- Visual Studio Code 1.68.1, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript
 
<br/>

### Results

Using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3, we re-factored the code of our index.html file to create a dashboard and then we modified the webpage using HTML and Bootstrap as shown in image (a).

## Summary

- For this project we were able to create a dynamic dashboard that provided the client an effective way to filter the data for each bacterial sample, and provided 3 visualizations that changed accordenly with the sample selection. In order to let the client to try and feel the app we deployed the webpage using GitHub pages:
