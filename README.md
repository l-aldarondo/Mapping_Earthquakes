# Mapping_Earthquakes
Creating interactive maps using the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL.

## Background
### Overview
This project consists of three technical analysis deliverables.

- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.


## Methodology

- Used JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. 

- Used Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Resources
 
Data source:
- (1) major_eq_starter_logic.js, (2) challenge_logic.js, (3) chart.js
 
Software:
- Visual Studio Code 1.68.1, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript
 
<br/>

### Results

Using JavaScript, Leaflet, and D3, we re-factored the code of our index.html file to create an interactive earthquake map as shown in image (a, b and c).

## Summary

- We created our earthquake map with two different maps (Fig a, b) and the earthquake overlay. Then we added the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5, and we added the data on a third map (Fig c).
